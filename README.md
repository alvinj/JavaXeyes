# README

This is a Java version of the old “Xeyes” application. I originally
wrote this code in 2011, so a lot of it looks really old, and it
currently relies on an API that may soon be deprecated. Other than
that, hey, it works, and feel free to clean up the code if you
have some free time.

P.S. - There’s supposed to be a short animation when the
application stops.
